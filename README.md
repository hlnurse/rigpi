# RigPi

<b>RigPi</b> provides Amateur radio station control, for MOMR (Multiple Operator, Multiple Radio, managed though accounts), CW Keying, logging, spot management, web display of station information, and a scheduling calendar. RigPi includes the FCC database or you can connect to QRZ through its subscription XML interface. It's GUI is browser based, so any browser (PC, Mac, phone, tablet) can be used to interact with RigPi.  It is designed for the Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4B. The RigPi image uses Bullseye, so it will not run on the Raspberry Pi 5.

RigPi uses Hamlib for rig and rotor control. External programs (such as WSJT-X) can share rig control by connecting to RigPi's rigctld or rotctld rotor processes.  Multiple radios can be connected, one for each account.  The number of simultaneous connections is limited by the resources of the Raspberry Pi.

RigPi includes many popular ham programs, including WSJT-X, Fldigi, TQSL, GridSquare and others.
